### **Pre-class Self-study Materials**

**Subject:** getting Ready for Data Science Lesson 1.6 **Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

**1\. Environment Setup:**

* Ensure VSCode is installed.  
* Install the "Jupyter" extension in VSCode.  
* Verify installation by creating a file named `test.ipynb` and running `print("Hello World")`.

**2\. Concept Primer (Video/Reading):**

* **Analogy:** "Think of a Python List like a delivery truck that can carry anything (a box, a chicken, a letter). It's flexible but slow to pack/unpack. Think of a NumPy Array like a specialized egg carton. It can *only* hold eggs (numbers), but because of that, we can stack, count, and ship them 100x faster."  
* **Key Term \- Vectorization:** Performing an operation on the whole list at once (like stamping 100 envelopes simultaneously) rather than one by one (loops).
